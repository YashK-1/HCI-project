Sports competition registration form

This is a web development project.
In this project, the visitors can register themselves for multiple sports by filling the registration form.
Once the form is submitted, the candidate's data is stored on a SQL database or a relational database.
After submitting, the visitors are redirected to another webpage that displays the schedule of the sports events.
The visitor can download the schedule in their device by clicking the download button, which will download an excel file in the visitor's device.

That's about it.
Thank you.
